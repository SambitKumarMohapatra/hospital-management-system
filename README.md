## 🐛 Known Bugs Fixed

- `@JsonIgnore` on `getDepartment()` was hiding department data in API response, breaking the doctor filter — fixed with `@JsonIgnoreProperties`
- JS appointment payload was sending nested objects while `AppointmentRequestDTO` expected flat fields — corrected request body structure
- Appointment booking was POSTing to wrong endpoint `/api/appointments` instead of `/api/appointments/book`
